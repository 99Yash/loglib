- **We passed 100 stars on github**: thanks for each and everyone who helped as achive this. We're grateful for your support. If you haven't starred us yet, please do so [here](https://github.com/loglib/loglib)
- **New look introduced**: Say goodbye to the slate look, We've embraced a fresh new stone color. We think it's beautful we hope you do too :)
- **The events tab introducs a filter**: You can filter events easily now. 
- **The dashboard graph introduced bar graph**: You can now switch between line and bar graph.
- **Tracker improvements**: The tracker introduces 2 primitives for event tracking on react:
    1. **Track View**: you can use track view to track when a use scrolled to a certain view. Read the [doc](/docs/advanced/track-view) here.
    2. **Track Click**: a helper componenet to track clicks. This is specially important if you need to track on a server component without chaning the component to client componenet. Read the [doc](/docs/advanced/track-click) here
- **Auto event tracking got better*: You can now turn on automatic event tracking just paass auto to the tracker. It'll track buttons and elements with onClick events.
