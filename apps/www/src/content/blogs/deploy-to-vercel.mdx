## Deploying a Website with Vercel
Vercel is a popular platform that allows you to easily deploy static websites, serverless functions, and full-stack applications. In this guide, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of deploying your website using Vercel.

### Prerequisit

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1. A Vercel account: Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up for an account if you don't have one already.
2. A website project: Make sure you have a website project ready to deploy. This could be a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or a framework like React or Next.js.

### Step 1: Install the Vercel CLI

To deploy your website using Vercel, you need to have the Vercel CLI (Command Line Interface) installed on your machine. Open your terminal and run the following command to install the CLI globally:


### Step 2: Log in to Vercel

After installing the CLI, log in to your Vercel account by running the following command in your terminal:


Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Vercel account.

### Step 3: Navigate to Your Project Directory

Using the terminal, navigate to the root directory of your website project. This is the directory that contains your project's `package.json` file.


The Vercel CLI will guide you through the deployment process. It will ask you questions about your project, such as the framework you're using, the build command, etc. Make sure to provide the necessary information as requested.

### Step 5: Customize Deployment Settings

Vercel allows you to customize various deployment settings for your website. For example, you can set environment variables, configure custom domains, and more. To customize your deployment settings, create a `vercel.json` file in the root directory of your project and define the desired settings.

### Step 6: Continuous Deployment (optional)

If you want to enable continuous deployment, which automatically deploys your website whenever changes are pushed to your Git repository, you can integrate Vercel with your Git provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). You can configure this through the Vercel dashboard or by using the Vercel CLI.

### Step 7: Monitor Your Deployment

Once your website is deployed, Vercel provides you with a unique URL where your website is accessible. You can monitor the deployment status, view deployment logs, and manage your deployments through the Vercel dashboard or by using the CLI.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your website using Vercel.
